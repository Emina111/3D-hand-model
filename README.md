# This is a project of a 3D-hand model in OpenGL. 
You can change the position of the camera which allows us to look at the hand from multiple angles.
There is also the possibility to open and close the hand, using both keyboard and animation.
There are two different sources of light on the scene.
I used Object-oriented approach, with following classes: Vector3, Hand, Light,
Camera.

In order to look at the hand from multiple angles, use navigating keyboards.
In order to start animation, press key 'o', and in order to stop it, press key 'O'.
You can also open and close hand slowly, by holding key 'a' and 'A', respectively.
